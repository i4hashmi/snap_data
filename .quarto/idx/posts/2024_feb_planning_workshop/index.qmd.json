Workshop</h1>\n\nWe held a planning workshop on the afternoon of 16 February 2024 with the aim of generating some ideas for activities SNAP could organise and participate in throughout 2024.\nThere was a good turn-out of PhDs and postdocs, especially from SCPS, as well as a number of staff (both academic and professional) including Rohit Duggal (pic below) who is the new HPC specialist looking after Rāpoi.\nThere was much lively discussion and brainstorming with lots of ideas generated, the PhD students were particularly enthusiastic and contributed many good ideas.\nIf you missed the planning workshop and have some ideas of your own please get in touch!\n\nThe planning workshop was followed by our regular SNAP community coffee meetup at Milk and Honey on 7 March.\nThere was some good discussion following up on some of the ideas discussed during the planning workshop, plus some new ideas!\nIf you are interested in coming to a community coffee meetup (next one is 1st May) or want to stay informed about any SNAP events held throughout the year, please get in touch and we'll add you to the SNAP email list!\n \n[![](RohitDuggalProfile.jpg){height=200
